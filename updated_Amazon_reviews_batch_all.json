Comparing them to all the ones I‚Äôve bought in-store or through Nike the quality was very poor. It lacked a lot of padding on the sides and heel, which makes it very thin along with increasing the chances of the fabric ripping. Not sure what‚Äôs going on but if you‚Äôre going to spend $100+ you may as well not get it from here."

This was the exact item his mom gave me on his Christmas list.  I was reluctant to buy from this vendor due to the negative reviews and the fact I had to pay a delivery fee. The package arrived much faster than was indicated.  But it turns out the sneakers were to small.  I started the return process and took the package to UPS .  it cost an arm and a leg to return them... But it was my choice to use them.  I also ordered the same sneakers in a new size, which also came very fast. The vendor received the return but after 2 days I still didn't receive my refund.  I contacted the seller requesting the refund.  Whitin hours they contacted me asking for the tracking number of the return.  Once I sent that info back they responded that I would receive the refund with 2 hours.  That's exactly what happened.  Overall, although it was a bit of a hassle, I was pleased with the product and the seller"

However I noticed after about 6 months the inner lining started to come off and you could see my socks through the top of the shoe. I made it a point to not do any physical activity in these as they are expensive. After about a year of owning a black out I purchased a white pair. The black pair continued to wear down inside showing more and more of my socks until I stopped wearing them. The Nike logo on the white pair flaked off eventually and after owning them for 1 year the air bubble actually popped. They may be comfortable but for a shoe I did no physical activity in they broke down very fast."

            "Combined_Review": "One of the worst sports shoes I‚Äôve ever owned! | As an athlete I‚Äôve worn many different types of shoes and different brands. This is the worst I‚Äôve ever owned. My heal is constantly coming out of this thing and it feels like there is little to no support. If you‚Äôre wearing them around the house they‚Äôre fine, but as soon as you do any physical activity you‚Äôll literally feel like your feet are coming out of the shoes and they often do when doing physical activity. They tried to be innovative with a flex back heal of the shoe and it just makes for instability and the shoe falls off really easily when you move quickly or make sudden movements. Would not recommend for any moderate physical activity. Go with a lace up shoe or ASICS in my opinion."

However that doesn't bother me, I probably look like i belong in that timeframe as well.Secondly, the shoes are relatively heavy. Again, that doesn't bother me too much as i used them for walking and gym/lifting, not running.Third - after wearing them for a couple of months i developed plantar fasciitis. I have relatively flat feet, and at some point they started really hurting. I replaced the insoles with some aftermarket ones designed to support flat feet and the pain went away.Fourth - the final straw - the shoes started squeaking loudly with every step. Ended up replacing them with Reebok Nano 2 - will see how those hold up."

After 30 days, there is something causing great pain across the top right side of my left foot.  I have compared this to the right shoe and I see and feel nothing that can be causing this pain.  The shoe is almost wearing a blister at the spot where the pain is.  I tried putting in a shoe comfort patch as the spot, but that has not helped.  As a Nike customer that has worn many Nikes through the years, I have to say between this pair and the prior 2 pairs not lasting a year each, I am going to try another brand.  I cannot recommend this shoe, I can no longer wear them."

Probably heavy and stiff for some folks, but as a tennis player and someone who likes to exercise outdoors these shoes are like having mini tanks on my feet. I feel indestructible with them on. The latest pair started to squeak after a few weeks.  I got another pair and the same problem developed.  Very bothersome, I can't wear them in public places.  Putting some sand under the sole helps temporarily. I'm still searching for a good wide shoe replacement for Nike. So sad, IDK why they don't fix it other than this is one of their oldest and cheapest models."

I have been purchasing this and have been comfortable with this shoe for many years.  All of a sudden it makes noise when I walk.  I am talking about a loud squeaking noise as I traverse hard or smooth surfaces, and even thick carpet..  At first I thought it was because the shoe was wearing out and needed to be replaced.  Not so, a brand new pair made the same noise.  This is now the third pair that is making the squeaks.  I went online to research this issue and found several similar complaints of recent and they provide some tangible repair by partially removing the insole and using baby powder or WD-40 to quiet the interaction of the insole to the sole.  It sort of works but that is not sufficient.  Why do I have to dismantle a new pair of shoes to repair it?  Nike needs to resolve this issue.  Putting a small packet of baby powder in the carton will not cut it."

The high level of support on the sole was the draw.  The sole is too stiff. I also found the high side profile of the shoe was an irritant on the lower side of my ankle.  When doing lifts such as squats, where the weight needs to be to the heels, these shoes were difficult.  When I would attempt to adjust my weight towards my heels, the stiff soles would raise my toes off of the floor and compromise my balance.  While squatting in these shoes I experience pain in my knees and had to reduce weight.  These shoes were also extremely uncomfortable during runs.  I have since discarded the Monarchs and replaced them with Reebok Nano 3 shoes.  I strongly reccomend the Nano 3 for flat footed crossfitters."

I am still evaluating item if it is too small or if it just feels that way because it is new but what does \"D\" on insole mean? Is that a narrower 10.5 than a regular? I compared the new Nike with my current pair and the size looks to be the same by eye. I don't know what \"D\" means and why this pair of Nikes feels small. See picture provided. Please advise.

Un calzado que podr√≠a llevar todo el d√≠a.Lo que no me ha gustado del calzado nuevo que me lleg√≥ (Nike Legend Essential 2 black and white) es que tiene un mallado diferente. Soy 41, pero estas zapatillas las compr√© en 42 (las viejas me quedan perfectas, las nuevas me aprietan un poco, pero supongo que con el tiempo se expandir√°n)Estaban en 42‚Ç¨ y termin√© pagando 34‚Ç¨ (env√≠o a canarias). Si salen igual de buenas que las anteriores, estar√© muy conforme. Siento que compr√© una oferta."

I ordered a half a size up, due to all the reviews stating so because these shoes run narrow and I'm glad I did. My normal shoe size is 8 but these shoes fit perfect in an 8 1/2. So I definitely recommend like other reviews to order a 1/2 size up, you can always return or exchange if things are different for you."

The box they came in looked like someone bought them, chucked them in a corner under a pile of other boxes, remembered they had them, tried them on, and sent them back. They were laced up pretty tight. I had to loosen them a bit. Right off the bat, I can feel that they were not comfortable. The toes had enough room to move around in, so much so, if I had extra toes my feet would be happy. They felt, how should I put this, like standing on a brick with a thin piece of foam on it. When walking, they squeak something awful. I took out the insert and tried them on without it. Yeah, that didn't stop the squeaking not to mention it was hard on the foot. I was told that they needed to be broken in. I don't know how much more running around I have to do before they are \"broken in\". I regret how much I paid for these. I'll stick with Skechers from now on."

Value for the money?  Mehhhh...kind of overpriced.  They're comfortable though.  I saw them on a guy in a restaurant and looked it up once I got home because they looked great on him.  They're not perhaps my favorite footwear but they work.  I'll get a lot of good use out of them I am sure.  Once I loosened up the straps, that made them fit better for sure."

A lot of cushion in the heel, where it counts. Because of the design, your whole body leans just a little forward. You expend less energy on flat surfaces and is easier to climb hills. One pair lasts about a year. I run in 10 degrees and 100 degrees. The sneaker preforms well in both temperatures."

Seriously, ANY dampness on walking surfaces will make these slip right from under you. If I can get 6-8 months of use from them without replacing the soles, they will be my go-to work shoe selection for many years to come. Just be nice if they made a non-slip version."

His friend had a tear in the same spot. I would not recommend these shoes."

The top is almost mesh you can see your socks through them so they are super breathable.  My other sneakers are a pair of Karhu.  I like my Karhu they are durable and cool but they are pretty heavy.  My other pair of sneakers are lace up canvas boat/skateboard style (similar to Vans).  Which once again i like the style and wear to work but they aren‚Äôt the most comfortable and not good if walking a lot.  These on the other hand are awesome for walking around all day long or light jogging and working out.  I would recommend and buy again."

They are relatively heavy compared to racing shoes, and they are not good for running at top speed. That being said, the shoes make good trainers/everyday shoes and are great for price."

Amazon was suppose to give me $10 compensation- even ‚Äútalked to manager‚Äù. ( rather than cancel and reorder to get them $10 cheaper I took them at their word).. however, I have yet to see any compensation. They‚Äôre all over the place with the price of shoes.. saw the save shoes on sale at kohls for $25 cheaper than Amazon. Will start shopping around before making future purchases. Especially if they‚Äôre going to start being stingy. Shoes are okay, however. Revolution 6 not as good as Revolution 5 or 7."

I wore my last pair almost every day for around a year, and they only started to really fray a few months into when I put a lot of pressure on them during weightlifting/leg press (which is clearly not what they're made for!). They're so comfortable, great for running/walking, and simple so they go with any outfit."

            "Combined_Review": "Not the best fit | The shoes themselves feel very thin and constructed poorly, and while some running shoes that are thin are that way for a reason, these feel like they'd start hurting after running a mile. They also feel very roomy/wide, so when running with them there is the potential for lots of movement (and therefore injury).For basic activities they work fine and are a decent shoe for the price, but if you plan on doing strenuous exercises that involve your feet I would avoid these.Looks-wise, the base is a LOT thicker than it looks in the pictures. The heel extends out beyond the back of the shoe by a good amount, giving it the \"Balenciaga Triple S\" look.Laces are high quality as expected from Nike, and despite the weird fit they do feel like they'd last a long time. The traction on the bottom is thicker than a typical running shoe so as long as you aren't dragging the top of your foot around I imagine it'd take a good bit of time before you'd need to buy new shoes."

            "Combined_Review": "Great..but both pairs I received were used | I buy used occasionally, since many times they come looking new, they're just cheaper! But when I buy something NEW, I expect it to actually be new.The first pair I ordered, I didn't pay attention to my own shoe size. When I opened them, I noticed they were a little dirty but were completely acceptable (just annoyed). Though I still had to return them because they were the wrong size. So I reordered them in the correct size.The second pair came in, and this pair was in worse condition. I would have returned these in a heartbeat had I not over the fact that I just went through returning and reordering these. These were dirtier, and threads were snagged.Sizing - pretty true to size, but if I had to lean one way, I'd say less than half a size on the small side. I wear size 8.5, so my second pair, I ordered that. My other shoes that are all 8.5 give me a little wiggle room in the toes. However these do not. My toes go right to the end. But, they still fit. The top is almost like sock material, so that may be why that doesn't seem to bother me.I have always loved Nike lunarglide, specifically the earlier versions (2010 time frame). They almost gave me a feeling of leaning forward and made mexfeel like i cpuld run fast and easy. But every new version that came out seemed to a little worse. These give me that feeling and I was super excited about that. I haven't had the chance to run in them yet, but for walking, they're perfect!If they weren't used, it would be 5 stars."

            "Combined_Review": "Comfort Comfort Comfort | I have an older version of this shoe, and it is one of the most comfortable pair of athletic shoes I have ever owned. It gets an A+ for cushion, but it lacks a bit in stability, like someone else mentioned on here. There is also an added comfort to the tongue and top of foot. I call it my foot pillow. When I‚Äôm out short distance jogging or light training, these are my go to shoes. If I go a little bit longer, I can still feel comfortable because usually what gets to me before I get tired is that the top of my foot can start to feel discomfort from the shoe laces bearing down on them. I also like the shoe laces that come with the shoes. They are also built for comfort and not super rigid.  As for everyone commenting on size, I have used Nike for most of my running career, and have always had to size up in running shoes, as opposed to daily walking around town shoes. I did run in these shoes and I purchased a half size bigger as usual, and they were great. Nike‚Äôs (maybe not all bust most lines) usually run more narrow than most other running shoes. There are a lot of running shoe brands that you should not buy true to size. You really need toe room. I like going to a professional at Fleet Feet to get sized up and try on a bunch of shoes. If they have the shoes I want there, I buy them, if not I can go online and buy a pair‚Ä¶ maybe with a web discount. But this show is super duper comfortable. I‚Äôve been running competitively since I was 12 and into my 50‚Äôs. I‚Äôm happy with this shoe."

The more I wear these shoes the more I like them. Cushioning is superior without being mushy. Support is average but enough for most I think. Sizing was the only thing that was so so - they do run narrow and I had to size up 1/2 size not to hit toes at the front in my normal shoe size. They do not stretch as much as I had expected so glad I went up in size. Great looking shoes on top of everything!"

Since they were getting a little discolored from normal wear, I decided to replace them with the same style as I enjoyed the look. No more than 2 weeks after getting them I started noticing the squeaky sound but this time even worse. Enough that I won't wear them if I going to be walking in a quiet area with people. Nike was the only brand I wore growing up but diversified as an adult. For sure I will not be buying this shoe again and I will be switching brands."

Already plan to order in another color or 2. Love Love Love em. I tried on the all white in a store and 12 extra wide were really loose on my feet, so I took a chance on these 12 regular and hit a home run!If you have wider feet definitely go with the wide as regular will definitely be too tight. And the wide is wider than most shoes in wide.I went with 12. Usually 11.5. Glad I went with 12. A perfect fit. Not sure what else to say."

Tried all the tricks listed online to stop the noise, nothing worked for very long. Not the quality they had in the past several have had the soles come unglued. Unfortunately I have pain in my heels and this shoe is the only one that relieves that pain. Tried other shoes and arch supports.

The only problem is that one shoe string was 56 inches and the other shoe string is 52 inches. This creates two problems: 1. The shorter string is a bit more difficult to tie due to the lack of length. 2. Once tied, the bow on one foot looks normal and the bow on the other foot looks stunted. I'm not sure why they couldn't get two shoe strings that equal 56 inches."

            "Combined_Review": "Not very slip resistant | The first day I wore these, I went for a walk, and upon my walk was a nice big pile of dog doo doo. I was unaware of this big pile of doo-doo until it was too late. As I flew ybackward, I recall looking up at the sky, and to my surprise, I saw one of my brand new shoes flying by.  Next thing I knew I was lying there on the cold, hard sidewalk in such shock I layed there for what felt like forever. I slowly began to rise to my feet. I started to check myself for any injuries when suddenly I got a whiff of a nostril-burning foul smell. I reached my hand around to my back only to bring it right back abruptly.  I let out a loud scream followed by a gagging reaction to the dog poop that was now on my hand.  I ran to the grass and dropped to my knees I frantically began wiping my hand on the grass. As a tear ran down my face I remembered thinking can this day get any worse? Well, guess what it did! Behind me was a loud bark that scared me so much I jumped forward. I was now lying on the ground once more. As I got to my knees, I stood up quickly, eager to see the culprit that I believed to be the doggy doo doo bandit, but as I turned around to confront this demon, I promptly began to plead because in this dogs mouth was my other shoe I slowly began to approach this dog as I got close enough I made a daring move I tried to jump on the dog. I was unsuccessful with dog poop on my back, and with only one shoe on, I began to walk home sad and smelly.  Anyway I hope this helps your decision to buy these shoes or not"

I have trouble bending over to slip these on, and a more rigid design would've been better. The soles are pretty thin, so of you stepped on a worn-out dime, you could definitely tell if it was heads or tails(Hank Sr.).My biggest complaint is the shoes have absolutely no purchase on smooth concrete. I work in a warehouse and I'm constantly slipping and sliding unless I'm walking slowly.Otherwise they're pretty comfy and lightweight. They don't breathe the best, but for this price, it ain't terrible."

I bought a pair for my son last Christmas, and believe me, these shoes have seen things. They've been on a two-year-long expedition into what I can only describe as the 'deep, dark abyss' of mud, rain, and every imaginable teenage adventure.The first pair, affectionately known as 'Mud Divers,' finally succumbed to the relentless exploration. They've been through it all - impromptu soccer games, unexpected puddle jumps, and those mysterious ventures into the woods that only teenagers understand. Yet, they held up with the resilience of a seasoned explorer.So, when Christmas rolled around again, guess what was at the top of my son's list? Another pair of these indomitable Nike Court Vision Lo Sneakers. This time, I'm half expecting them to come with a built-in compass and a survival guide!As for the shoes themselves, they're stylish enough to get approving nods from his fashion-conscious peers and durable enough to withstand his outdoor shenanigans. The comfort level must be through the roof because he wears them like they're part of his feet. I'm beginning to wonder if Nike secretly crafts these with some kind of teenage invincibility technology.If you have a teenager who treats sneakers like they're all-terrain vehicles, Nike's Court Vision Lo Sneakers are the way to go. They're tough, they're trendy, and they might just be the only pair of shoes your teen will ever willingly wear. Here's to hoping the new pair enjoys the same legendary status as the 'Mud Divers'!"

I can't walk down a hallway without someone noticing that high pitch squeak.My purchase is still within the \"return\" window but am not sure they'd take it back since they've been used for a week now. In addition, I've already tossed out my previous pair of sneakers so I am stuck with this pair unless they send me a replacement first :/I do not recommend this model.

After a couple times wearing them the left sneaker started a horrible squeaking noise, even on carpet.  Was not the outside of the shoe on the floor, it was inside the sneaker.  Because I liked the color and style and couldn't find another one as nice (to me) I decided to return and try another pair. I kept the first pair until i could wear the second pair.  After a couple times now the right sneaker started the same squeaking noise. I returned the 2 squeakers and kept the non-squeakers as a pair. After a coupe more times wearing them both sneakers have started to squeak. Will be returning the second pair this weekend."

He is a letter carrier for USPS and his shoes don‚Äôt last very long. So far these shoes not only look nice but have actually held up. His shoes always separate at the seams or tend to get holes at the top or tears. Although, he wipes them down every once and awhile and the shoes look new again. We are both very impressed at the quality of this shoe. These are the first shoes he‚Äôs had, that are not boots, which have actually survived his heavy foot. His shoes for work have never lasted this long. Especially, with all the walking he does on a daily basis. He says they don‚Äôt hurt his feet and they are easy to maintain. He also likes the holes at the top which help with ventilation in the summer. His only complaint is the shoe laces. He says they are too short so it makes it hard for him to tie his shoes. It wasn‚Äôt too big of an issue because he can buy a new set of  inexpensive laces. However, it is something to keep in mind. He is usually a 9.5 and I bought a size 9. He said he was worried at first when he started wearing his shoes because the side of the shoe where his pinky toe rests started to become a bit sore. Yet, after the first few days the shoe seemed to have stretched and he said it is now not a problem. He said the tread where his heel is has also begun to wear out but most of the tread is still there. He said he assumes it is because of all the stairs he goes up and down everyday. All in all he is happy with these shoes."

The first time I tried these snickers they were very stiff, causing heel slippage and narrow. I don't buy shoes and keep my fingers crossed hoping the leather will stretch over time. The length wasn't really a problem. It was the width. Either way I don't spend money and hope that over time they will fit properly"

            "Combined_Review": "Solid Shoe. Red Flag Seller. | 2 parts to this review:1) The shoe itself2) The quality control1) nice classic shoe design. Toe cap is a little flatter than expected and it does run small. I ordered a half size up, which was just right.2) Smudges around the sole. Nothing egregious that couldn't be easily cleaned off but there should be zero markings! There seemed to be no wear but I might want to take a closer look to make sure. It doesn't quite seem these were pre worn but perhaps stored poorly/not in proper packaging, which leads me to my next point on QC...This is clearly not an originally Nike-purchased product. It came in a non Nike box and no Nike tags. There was no tissue paper/packing material in the box and nothing inside the shoe to keep the toe cap's shape. This leads me to think the shoes are fake or at the very least have gone through multiple distribution sources.Conclusion: good classic design that matches with anything. Major QC/seller red flags and the shoes were dirty and arrived in some janky packaging. If it were just the shoe it would've been 5 stars but I took off 1 star each for the smudges and packaging that indicate these may be fake."

As someone who works tirelessly at a no-kill animal shelter, I cover anywhere from 7 to 10 miles on my feet each day. These shoes have been an absolute game-changer for me.First and foremost, the comfort level is outstanding. I used to experience foot fatigue and discomfort after long hours of walking and standing, but these slipper-like shoes have made all the difference. They provide ample cushioning and support, allowing me to keep going without the constant ache and soreness I used to feel.Not only are they comfortable, but they're also incredibly lightweight, which makes my daily tasks at the shelter even more manageable. I no longer feel weighed down by heavy footwear, and that's a significant relief.The durability of these shoes is also commendable. Given the rigorous demands of my job, I was concerned about wear and tear, but they've held up remarkably well. I can confidently say that they are up to the challenge of my daily routine.In summary, the Nike Men's Gymnastics Shoes Slipper has been a true lifesaver for my feet. I'm no longer plagued by discomfort and fatigue, allowing me to focus on my important work at the animal shelter. I highly recommend these shoes to anyone who needs both comfort and durability in their footwear."

The new pair feels like it‚Äôs lacking a full layer of cushioning, so much so that they‚Äôre even uncomfortable to walk in, let alone run.There seems to be a factory defect with my pair, so beware if you‚Äôre buying the black and green color. I wonder if the word ‚ÄúPlatform‚Äù in the product title has anything to do with it. Either way, the low price (~$58) was too good to be true."

            "Combined_Review": "The worst running shoe I have ever bought | They look comfortable and when you put them on for the first time you think this will be a good running shoe. Then you realize they have very little padding. After a couple of runs it feels like they have almost no padding at all. So I stopped running in them and just use them to walk around as everyday shoes. However I may have to stop using them for that as they make an irritating squeaking noise when walking on carpeted areas.  I find it frustrating to spend $100 for something marketed as a running shoe that is so cheaply made. I have been consistently disappointed by Nike ever since they stopped making the Pegasus 34. Every running shoe they have made since then keeps getting worse. I can't understand why they took something that was good for so many years and ruined it. I won't be buying Nike again."

            "Combined_Review": " | Als begeisterter Sneaker-Liebhaber habe ich mir k√ºrzlich den Nike Herren Downshifter 12 Sneaker zugelegt und m√∂chte meine Eindr√ºcke teilen.Der erste Eindruck der Schuhe ist √§u√üerst positiv. Das moderne Design des Downshifter 12 verleiht ihm eine vielseitige √Ñsthetik, die sich leicht in verschiedene Outfits integrieren l√§sst. Die Verarbeitung ist, wie von Nike gewohnt, hochwertig und robust, was auf eine langlebige Qualit√§t hindeutet.Was den Tragekomfort betrifft, so kann ich sagen, dass die Downshifter 12 Sneaker ihre Versprechen halten. Die Polsterung im Inneren der Schuhe sorgt f√ºr eine angenehme D√§mpfung, was besonders bei l√§ngeren Spazierg√§ngen oder sportlichen Aktivit√§ten sp√ºrbar ist. Die Passform ist ebenfalls bemerkenswert, und der Schuh bietet ausreichend Halt, ohne dabei unbequem zu sein.Ihr ist f√ºr mich jedoch ein Negativpunkt vorhanden. Meine F√º√üe sind etwas breit, weswegen die Schuhe etwas zu dr√ºcken scheinen, aber dennoch komfortabel sind.Die Sohle des Downshifter 12 ist gut gestaltet und bietet eine ausgezeichnete Traktion auf verschiedenen Oberfl√§chen. Egal, ob ihr auf der Stra√üe unterwegs seid oder leichte sportliche Aktivit√§ten aus√ºbt, die Schuhe geben das Vertrauen und die Stabilit√§t, die man ben√∂tigt.Ein weiteres Plus ist die Atmungsaktivit√§t der Schuhe. Auch bei l√§ngeren Tragezeiten bleibt das Fu√üklima angenehm, was insbesondere an warmen Tagen oder w√§hrend intensiverer sportlicher Aktivit√§ten wichtig ist.In Bezug auf die Haltbarkeit hat Nike auch hier gute Arbeit geleistet. Die Materialien zeigen wenig Abnutzungserscheinungen, und die Schuhe behalten ihre Form auch nach h√§ufigem Tragen bei.Zusammenfassend kann ich sagen, dass die Nike Herren Downshifter 12 Sneaker eine gelungene Kombination aus Komfort, Stil und Funktionalit√§t sind. Ob f√ºr den Alltag oder leichte sportliche Bet√§tigungen, diese Sneaker erf√ºllen die Anforderungen an einen zuverl√§ssigen und modischen Schuh. Ich kann den Nike Downshifter 12 Sneaker jedem empfehlen, der auf der Suche nach einem vielseitigen und bequemen Schuh ist."

These were a bit uncomfortably tight for the first few days, but they've broken in nicely and now a few weeks in I quite like them.They've been great for every day wear, very easy on my feet and legs. Great feel when I run trails, treadmill, or just do my commute hike.The flat laces have a nice feel but untie relatively easily- I'll probably replace those.The weirdest thing is this attractive but baffling tread pattern that just devours pebbles, debris, mude, and other substances. I've attached a photo with just a few little rocks in the tread, but understand that anything you step in can really work its way into these crevices. I regularly pop out these rocks with my pocket knife, but I am really dreading the day I don't see some dog's neglected nugget left in the grass- that's gonna be a problem."

Makes me think perhaps they were bought previously and then returned. These Nike Sneakers were not cheap. However the packaging makes them look as though they are second hand. Would like to return but thinking I'll get the same shoe box without the lid and I need them for a gift!"

They feel like slippers, yet they are also supportive and I can walk in them for 5 miles without blinking an eye or being sore.... so why 4 stars instead of5... well, if I had a nickle for evertime I had to get a screw, or a rock or a million other things out of the sole because it has these perfectly sized catchers mitts to pickup small items on the ground. I really dislike the pattern on the sole. Super annoying. But I still love you Nike free run 2018. And also the laces come undone alot... despite being double knotted tightly."

I just pulled out the second shoe and it shows wear!!!!  My original review was based on my order of the shoe, but when they arrived I pulled out one shoe confirmed size and color and put them away.  Now that I am ready to use them I found that the second shoe is warn and dirty.  I have exceeded the return date, but hoping the seller will allow a return or replace these so I can wear them.How about it?"

Also, the bottom is very smooth and not made for wet or slippery surfaces. You definitely have to be careful on a treadmill, for example. The fist sign of wear for me started at the toe. They look great but the quality could use some work. Do yourself a favor and invest in a more quality shoe if training is the goal."

They are perfect for walking, running errands, or just hanging out with friends. The sizing is spot on.However,  these sneakers can be VERY slippery on smooth concrete surfaces, especially when wet.  I ended up biffing it pretty bad this morning when I stepped on my concrete garage floor with wet shoes and I'm now nursing a swollen and badly bruised knee.Nike Tanjun sneakers are still a great choice and I'll end up buying another pair, but just be careful when wearing them if it has rained outside."

They were totally fine at first, but after a while they started digging into the side out step of my foot - which is kind of weird, I‚Äôve never had shoes dig in there.But the way the shoe is designed and the sole makes it so that it‚Äôs a lot less flexible in the middle part of the outstep, so it really digs into my feet and I can‚Äôt really tighten or loosen to avoid it. It was fine at first but for some reason as the shoe broke in it got worse. There was one week where I wore them for a day and it was so bad my foot was sore right where it was digging in for the rest of the week.Unfortunately I think these will be going in the donation bin :/ such a shame as they look nice and the price is good."

I have small narrow feet, but the tongue of the shoe isn't separate from the sides, so there's not a huge amount of space to get the foot in. It fits perfectly once I'm in, but I was panicking a bit when I tried them on with thicker socks and struggled. A wide foot may not be the right one for this shoe."

I've had these for a couple of months now and it has been a constant struggle with grip. I can't tell you how many times I've almost fallen out in public places because these shoes slide on almost any type of flooring. It's like slipping when there's water pooled up on the floor, but when I check there never is water. It's just these dang shoes. The fit is good and I really like the breathable material they are made of. But I don't trust these shoes for running, with the experiences I've had. I won't even use them on my treadmill. I ended up buying another pair Nike of shoes for HIIT and running. These are just out and about shoes, now."

The sole is flexible for a sneaker while still providing some cushion.I think these are good for like trail jogging or working out in a gym or other type of cushioned floor.I don't think there's enough cushion for running on the road.It's nice how there's not a huge drop so you can still have a fairly natural stride.I'd recommend ordering up half a size as the thing over the pinky toe side of the foot feels a little bit weird."

I have the Adidas 4DFWD Pulse‚Äôs that do great and I do not get any pain on runs and now these Nike Pegasus 39s! They‚Äôre two different shoes but these do great and give me no pain and help prevent shin splits and knee pain I get with non running shoes. I should also mention I‚Äôm a new runner and still working on technical running form but these shoes are definitely worth the hype. I will say I have a wider foot and was worried initially with how they felt in the shoe. They were pretty tight, but I loosened them as much as I could, and decided I would test them for a week, and after the second day, I felt like I broke them in and even though the toebox is pretty narrow for my feet. It isn‚Äôt some thing that‚Äôs going to keep me from wearing them, but I will say my next order of these shoes will be at least a half size up for maximum comfort."

I tried other (cheaper) brands unsuccessfully, so I came back to this brand.  My normal shoe size is men‚Äôs 10 medium, but went with 10.5 to accommodate thicker running socks. I wanted to get the same aqua blue color as the previous pair but went with the orange pair (which was almost half the price).  I‚Äôm pleased with the fit and the air cushion feel. Primary use is for running at a high school track and on the treadmill. This pair is right for me and should last a while. Kudos to Amazon for carrying a decent selection and free delivery, didn‚Äôt have to mess with driving around town and looking."

I used to order 9 in Tanjuns. With the newer ones, I have to order 10.The sole and the build of the shoe are still comfortable so I'm probably keeping them. I just wish they still made them the way they used to several years ago."

Upon receiving them and putting them on,  she was blown away at how comfortable they are to wear. She said after a full day at work, she had ZERO foot or back pain which for her, inls completely unheard of so she immediately went and found these for me. I am a military veteran and just for some basic background, I have had FIVE right knee surgeries (one of which was a partial replacement), I've got plantar fasciatis as well a large fibrosis in my extremely high arches, severe chronic back and hip pain and have had on a surgery to fuse two vertebtae in my spine and on top of all of that, walk on concrete all day at work myself and generally speaking with ANY shoe or boot I wear (except my RedWing Irish Setter boots), I absolutely MUST wear some kind of custom orthotic. I got these shoes, put them on inside of the house to wear around and kinda break them in and did NOT insert my insoles and I can hardly take these things off. THESE ARE HANDS-DOWN, THE MOST COMFORTABLE SHOES I HAVE EVER WORN!!! I used to have to either wear Nike Shox (before they changed up the design then all but discontinued them) or ASICS Gel or Brooks. I have tried the ON and the Hokas but can't wear them and these are like socks that I can wear anywhere and not worry about stepping on rocks and stuff. Love them!!!!"

Just the right amount of platform to make them trendy but not too glaringly.  As some have pointed out they are a bit heavy and very little cushion inside.  Despite all that I would have tried adding an insert and kept them if they weren't so dang narrow.  (They are so shallow inside that unless you could remove the insole - I didn't check if you could before returning - you actually may not be able to add insole cushion.)  I'd read that they were narrow and ordered up a 1/2 size in hopes but that still didn't make a difference, even with no socks.  Very very narrow but very cute.  Sadly, I had to return."

I had to return the first pair for a half size smaller as my foot was literally slipping out when walking.  Second they are SO cute! Exactly what I wanted and go with literally everything. BUT‚Ä¶  They are the MOST UNCOMFORTABLE shoes I‚Äôve ever worn. There is no padding, and no give. It‚Äôs like walking with bricks on your feet. I haven‚Äôt decided if I‚Äôll keep them or not bc I wanted to cry midway through my work day in them. Makes me sad to even say it because they are so cute."

I have had the sole slimmed down by a foot doctor. This has relieved some pressure but not enough to make walking comfortable.  I have given up and ordered a new pair of Pegasus running shoes. Since I am 68 and mostly walk for exercise, I thought the hiking shoes would be more comfortable. Wrong."

I finally decided to purchase them and they didn‚Äôt even arrive in an original box. They came wrapped in a plastic bag and a small brown plain cardboard box. I was dissatisfied as the stitching looks cheap, they have a weird shape (look deformed), and they are not comfortable. My brother wanted a pair and we found them at a shoe store at the mall for $89.00. We compared them with the ones I purchased and there were some differences, also his shoes came with the original box and everything. So I ended up paying about $100.00 more, they didn‚Äôt come in an original Nike shoe box, and I feel like they are not original."

The reason I give 4 stars is because the picture is misleading for the color of the shoes. The picture shown by the seller shows more of a cream color, where in person and shown in the picture I took, it's more of a white grey. They still look nice and I love the shoe so I'm still keeping them regardless, but just be aware!"

White is a great shoe color and most running shoes look ugly in my opinion.I was concerned coming into this with how dirty it would look due to dirt, but it's actually very manageable. Simply throw it in the washing machine with some Oxyclean, air dry, and it looks nearly brand new. If excessively soiled, soak in Oxyclean overnight and then wash.The fit is true to size but slightly snug as you break it in. The entire front of the shoe is like a soft mesh so it's very comfortable, but that also means if you kick anything it'll hurt, trust me. The cushion is pretty good- an upgrade over non running shoes but not excessive like Hoka's. I can walk for about one and a half hours before my feet actually start hurting.Overall, would recommend. Definitely is kinda pricey but it's hard to find good looking running shoes so it's an L I was willing to take."

Since these are all black, they blend in when they need to and don't look dirty (if even they probably are...).

I had to unlace and tie them again until I got them to feel okay. I do love how light they feel and the look of the shoes looks great. The cushioning does not feel as good as I was hoping either. Their is these swirly lines on the cushions that make my feet feel weird when I wear them. Lastly the shoes don‚Äôt fit as tightly as I had thought. I have always been a size 9 and my feet do fit in them but it feels like theirs this small gap in the back when I walk and the front end of the shoe skids on the sidewalk when I‚Äôm walking sometimes. Not sure why these shoes were so high toy related. I recommend looking for something else."

            "Combined_Review": "New Tongueless slip on design comes at the expense of comfort | If you can get your hands on an older style of this shoe, get it.  Reviewers mention that for some reason the newer style is tighter across the big toe bridge or big toe mound and it is. That is because in order to accommodate the tongueless slip on style, the lace-up area had to extend at least an inch more toward the toe end of the shoe.  This means all the stitching relative to the top of the lace-up mock tongue lies straight on top of your big toe knuckle, generally the widest part of most people's foot. The shoe on the right is an old worn style size 8.5 and very comfortable.  I tried women's size 9 and 9.5 of the new style and gotten no relief. However, I love the feel of the old style of these shoes.  I resolved the issue by going with a man's size 7.5 pictured on the left.  The men's shoe is too big is some ways, but not painful across the top of the metatarsal. The men's color choices are less appealing as well. Unless you have a very narrow foot, I would not recommend these shoes.  The design change is not a plus.  I'm going to hang on to the old ones until the y fall completely apart."

I was under the impression that they were in mens and women because of the way it was set up on my account, but they are in mens. Overall, I bought these shoes as a basketball player, and was excited to wear them because I thought they were cute. But I will have to find my size and buy another pair."

My normal \"walking style\" shoe would be a 9.5, but for Nikes, I always go up a half size, so the 10 fits me perfectly.  I have this shoe in two different colors, and just ordered a third pair, as I plan to wear my older ones on vacation, and have a fresh pair to wear to workout when I get home."

I purchased on pair from Macys, then another from Finish line and finally two more pair from Nike.  Although, I will not pay the going rate of $300-$400, I decided to get this color for $200.  This is a spectacular buy!  I walk all day (as an elementary principal) so these shoes are an absolute delight.  I‚Äôve kept them on for 12 hours at work and didn‚Äôt have an inkling to take them off once I made it home from work; this is how comfortable they are - each day.  I feel as if I‚Äôm walking on air.  Try these - you‚Äôll love them!Xion & Xavier‚Äôs Mom,JLP in STLüòä"

            "Combined_Review": "Vibrant Red Shoe with Mixed Feelings Really bright red! | If you have an affinity for bright, attention-grabbing colors, this shoe will undoubtedly catch your eye. However, it turned out to be a bit too intense for my personal taste. I was expecting a deeper shade of red, more akin to the color of the shoe's trim, which I believe would have been a better fit for my style.The shoe itself is undoubtedly well-made and comfortable, but the overwhelming red hue detracted from my overall satisfaction. The craftsmanship and quality are commendable, and I found no issues with the shoe's design or construction. Nonetheless, it's crucial to consider individual preferences when choosing footwear.While this vibrant red shoe might not be my ideal choice, I can see how it could be a perfect match for someone who enjoys making a bold fashion statement. If you're looking for a shoe that will undoubtedly draw attention and brighten up any outfit, this could be the perfect option for you.In conclusion, the color of this shoe was not to my liking, but that doesn't take away from its overall quality and appeal. If you're a fan of eye-catching, vivid reds, this shoe could be a fantastic addition to your wardrobe. However, if you prefer a more subtle color, I would suggest exploring other options or considering the color of the trim, which might align better with your personal style."

That was until I saw it on amazon but I was still a bit skeptical.When they arrived, I got exactly what I wanted! The sneakers themselves looks amazing, comfortable and they fit true to size. It feels like I'm standing on air. The Nike box itself came undamaged and perfectly in tact.If you or anyone you know needs great sneakers to walk, stand or run in for long periods of time, this sneaker is at the top of the list and this seller would be the place to get it from! :)"

I got them specifically for basketball and unfortunately I bought 2 pair. Neither lasted 3 weeks. When I say neither lasted 3 weeks, I mean at about the 3 week mark, they had shredded and come apart to the point I fear too much for my safety to use them as I don't want my feet to bust through them.If you don't play sports, they're probably great. They're comfortable and look good but I legitimately can't make an argument for paying more than $10 for these pieces of trash.I think it's important also to note, I'm going to be 47 years old this month. I'm not some star athlete. I play pick up games at my local park and these shoes aren't durable enough for even that."

Even though I went small, they broke in nicely. I can wear them without tying them, or I can tie them up to make them more secure. The only downside is they squeak a bit when you walk. Only noticeable in very silent environments, and if that kind of thing annoys you, then idk go buy some converse or something. I really can‚Äôt stress how much I love these shoes."

The first pair were too big (size 9) so I returned them and bought another pair with the intentions of comparing the sizes side by side and returning the pair that we weren‚Äôt going to keep. When we received the second pair, they did fit (size 8 1/2) but with some notable differences.First, we noticed that the sizes was wrong on the tag. They fit perfect as a size 8.5 but the tab read size 7. Second, we noticed that the side sole had a weird texture that the first pair did not have. Next, we noticed the insert were different colors. The first pair had neon green inserts and the second pair had white inserts which was weird. But the one difference the stood out the most was the NIKE logo on the back of the shoe by the ankle. The logo were different in size the second pair being smaller than the first pair. We weren‚Äôt convinced so we decided to return the second pair as well and got a third pair. We returned the first two pairs and received the third pair of size 8.5 yesterday and they‚Äôre perfect. They perfectly resemble the first pair with the correct size, insert, sole texture and the NIKE logo in the back. Not sure if the second pair were knock offs but definitely were not the same as the two other pairs."

            "Combined_Review": "Extreme heal cushioning | I have a problem with a hip--unless I have really good cushioning, I develop hip pain.  I've found the solution is to order about 3-4 pair of Niki shoes, which generally have better heal cushioning than most athletic shoes, then keep the single pair with the best heal cushioning.  This particular model--Niki Air Max Pre Day--have the best cushioning of any I've ever gotten.  In fact, I got an extra pair just to have them ready when my present ones wear out.  A warning:  the  heal cushioning is so extreme that some people probably wouldn't prefer it, but for me it's exactly what I want.  BTW--I'm always worried when I order new Nikis that they won't fit, but they always do.  Niki never changes it's shoe sizes."

I have never needed to replace a pair of shoes before 6 months even at 100 miles a week.I currently run 10-15 miles a week. I wear my Pegasus only to run in. I noticed the foam starting to degrade 2 months ago and the tread was getting low a month ago. This week the souls started coming apart.Additionally they have drastically changed the stability and way these shoes roll as you run in the last few models. The heel feels too big and the point in the back is beyond stupid. Nobody strikes so far back that it will make a difference and it lifts your leg too far off the ground when you stretch resulting in your knee trying to turn itself backward.Nike made essentially the same show for 20 years then decided to ruin them. I tried the vomero a few times but they were too cushioned and still had the point in the back. At $50 more and no better it‚Äôs not worth it to stay with Nike."

Unfortunately, this particular model was super narrow (like most Nike shoes) and I couldn't even wear them a full day. If your feet are narrow or even typical width, I urge you to try these because they are amazing on your feet."

They fit as advertised and stayed connected to my feet. The cushion was perfect on cement with enough flex but not unstable. Fabric around the shoe enabled air to flow through and light enough for an easy 5K. Initially, I was worried about the fishtail shaped tongue but I didn‚Äôt have any issues. I‚Äôd give it 5 stars if the shoe ran for me."

I really liked my pair from last year!  I still have them. They are the most comfortable shoe.  There is something definitely wrong with this shoe, and I wish I would have seen the other reviews before I wasted my time and purchased. My feet are narrow, and these shoes in my typical size and the size as my previous are very tight in the toe and on top/sides of the foot. My foot bulged out on the sides. Upon putting them on, I noticed it was difficult getting my foot into. I wore them in my house thinking maybe they needed to be broken in and ended up with both feet aching on top for two days with severe pain in my toes joints from only one hour of wearing them. If I would have gone up to a 9.5, the shoe would have been too long. I will be returning these. These are definitely not the same cut I bought before. These aren‚Äôt even worth it if offered for free."

Well snug. And I don't like allot of pressure on the tops of my feet. These are really comfortable. I'm a flat footed person with NO arch and these Do Not hurt my feet at all. They do provide comfort all day stock. No inserts. They wear great with blue jeans, shorts. Not tacky looking. When I placed my order these puppy's were shipped within 24 hours and to the house by 72 hours several states away. üôÉ the box only looked like it had been dropped kicked 1 time nothing too harsh in the shipping bag so they're discreet.

I ordered the women's nike, but... I'm not sure what went wrong. Perhaps they gave me the men's size instead. It's been my experience that shipping items back for a refund can be complicated,  time consuming and costly to the customer. I guess,  some things are best bought at a retail store, rather than online."

These shoes have quickly become my go-to footwear for the volleyball court.The first thing that caught my attention was the sleek design. The black and white colorway gives them a clean and modern look, and they easily match any basketball attire. But it's not just about aesthetics - the performance of these shoes is outstanding.The Zoom Air cushioning provides excellent responsiveness and impact protection, making those quick cuts and jumps feel effortless. I noticed a significant improvement in my agility and speed while wearing these. The traction is top-notch, providing a solid grip on the court without any slipping.Another notable feature is the lightweight construction. These shoes feel incredibly comfortable on my feet, allowing for extended play without any discomfort or fatigue. The breathable materials also help keep my feet cool during intense games.Durability-wise, the materials used seem to be of high quality. I've been putting these through some serious playtime, and they still look and feel like new. The reinforced areas around high-stress zones provide extra confidence in their longevity.Overall, the Nike Zoom Hyperspeed Court CI2964 010 is a top-tier volleyball shoe that delivers on both style and performance. Whether you're a casual player or a serious athlete, these shoes are worth every penny. I highly recommend them to anyone looking to elevate their game on the court!"

            "Combined_Review": "Much easier‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ | There are a lot of reviews based on actually using these shoes for running and the fact that the zipper is useless, I would definitely agree with that assessment. However, in my case or I should say my son‚Äôs case, they are awesome.  My son is disabled and wears braces or AFO‚Äôs on his legs. His shoes have to be able to fit over them and it can be difficult to get a shoe that fits properly and still able to get them on easily.  These shoes are the answer, by being able to open the heal of the shoe using the zipper the shoe slides on very easily.  It saves us lots of time and energy fighting shoes over the AFO‚Äôs without folding in or forcing them over the heal. They‚Äôve been a real blessing.On a side note. They can be a little difficult getting the zippers pull all the way closed on one foot or the other depending on what handed you are. It only takes time learning how to position the zipper to get it to zip easily. This is the only reason I‚Äôm giving them 4 stars."

However, there is one critical concern: the outsole curvature underneath your smaller toes is too steep and the shoe tapers off of the floor up towards your toes at a steep angle. this can mean that if you take sharp cuts while running, your foot position isn‚Äôt as secure as you might be used to with other shoes if you land on your toes. It took me a couple games to get used to this but I almost fell over because of this the first few games. I now play with these shoes on a regular basis and they work great."

The shoes do not appear to be worn; the soles are clean and smell brand new. However, to my disappointment the canvas part of both shoes are stained. It is noticeable, especially when you spend $145 on what you expect to be new, CLEAN shoes.

            "Combined_Review": "Not impressed | My husband‚Äôs review: I bought these about a year ago. I ran 3 miles in them the day after I purchased them and I immediately realized that the upper is by far less comfortable than the non-gortex version. However, I thought that if the Gortex did it‚Äôs job than the sacrifice of comfort would be worth it. Well, a while later I tested them on a trail with wet grass and woodlands (with no puddles), and after 15 minutes my feet were soaked. A representative from Nike was very nice but they said I was outside the return time. They also said to consider, if the water came in through the top of the sock lining that the shoe isn‚Äôt designed to prevent water from saturating in from the top. But, it was not actively raining and I did not run through any puddles that submerged my feet. Also, I was certain the moisture was not sweat. I did give the shoes multiple chances to perform better but they continue to disappoint. Having said all of that, I have a $200+ pair of shoes that are uncomfortable and not weather proof. Moreover, they‚Äôre too uncomfortable to even wear as daily shoes. I gave them 2 stars instead of 1 star because the outsole is still very grippy and very plush. But, save your money."

At first, the slides are a bit tight and not as squishy in the sole. The good news is, they will loosen up as you wear them so they are nice and comfortable. The sole is still a bit more firm than his other pair, but they offer good support regardless. He wears them everyday!"

Just take a look.When a seller posts an item at a retail full price, then sends you shoes that have cleary been cleaned, think to yourself... it's that is the right seller to be giving your funds to?Just because the item was posted to look a specific way, doesn't mean the seller can always accomplish that exact look.I am disappointed in the quality and look of these shoes. Any type of discount to your ship would be appreciated for consideration.Thank you,Brandi"

I think the center becomes unglued or something.  I wear them to gym with headphones and forget how noisy they are until i take off my headphones. A Real let down for what Ipaid. I wish Nike would bring back the Shox NZ. I value these at $40.00 max."

However, maybe because I have short legs or a low profile foot, the back of the heel seems to hit very high up and cause awful blisters.  I am going to try heel cushions, if that doesn't work the only thing I can think of is to cut some of the material off the top.  Wondering if anyone else has this problem."

I use this shoes for training and group class. I find it‚Äòs good for running and not too heavy weight lifting. But in some group class that I have to  move my feet actively in a different positions my feet get really tired and also I find myself difficult to balance if I have to stand on one leg!"

I bought these in 11.5 and my toe was right to the end of the shoe. I could not wear them for more than 10 minutes. So I had to buy a size 12US. They fit a bit better, could have even gone a half size bigger for more comfort. The problem with that is they make your foot look so big."

This pair of boots was not the comfortable fit I've been used to with Nike footwear. In an effort to make this boot durable they totally forgot the comfort - and have definitely left out some needed room to fit your feet. After 1 week of wearing these boots I can't stand the thought of putting them on again. They are so incredibly uncomfortable, and I have multiple blisters. Given the fact that I spent over 20 years in the Infantry (Army) without any problems with my feet, that's pretty damning."

It was listed as White and Blue, with an adjustment so the third color looks like a deep red. The reality is that it's a putrid dayglow orange, which doesn't fit with the other colors at all.

This is the first time I‚Äôve tried the TRAIL. I have not use them to run in and I probably won‚Äôt and they‚Äôre pretty light colors so I probably won‚Äôt use them to go trail walking.

Best shoes ever, recently searched them online and found they are in production 10 years later and can‚Äôt be more excited. These shoes fit very well, they are super super comfy. These ones are for casual times, I have a pair I work in too that aren‚Äôt the all white because that would be a nightmare to keep clean. Usually buy my shoes directly from Nike but this seller had the color I wanted and they were the only source that had a size 14 available. They get this weird click noise after a little bit of wear when you walk on a polished surface like tile or concrete, like a little air bubble snap towards the heel on the sole just a weird design flaw but I love these shoes so much and will continue to refresh my shoes with this exact style as long as I can"

This shoe has a design feature I wasn't aware of when I ordered it, a sewn in tung that I absolutely dislike. So far it's been very difficult to get my foot inside the shoe. I have to fight it every time I go to put these shoes on. The tung is made of web material and I'm assuming they though it would be stretchable enough to not be an issue?  I would really like to return these shoes but once they're on I'm happy. I hoping the material will stretch over time but maybe I'll have to resort to breaking out my scissors."

            "Combined_Review": "Not as nice or comfy as I remember Nike Free Running Shoes to Be | I bought these because they had the \"old\" or first generation Nike Free tread pattern. The one with deep horizontal and vertical sipes or cuts in the thread to allow for maximum flexibility.The new or 2nd gen tread pattern is hexagonal and not nearly as flexible.So I expected these shoes to feel like older models of Nike Free shoes, which were incredibly comfortable. Both for being light and flexible and having just the right of cushioning for running on the pavement but still feeling more \"free\" and barefoot-ish than regular shoes.Unfortunately, these shoes come without a tongue and that makes them too tight on the foot for real comfort. You can't adjust the tightness and so they push down on the top of your foot which hurts after a while.The shoes also aren't as light as they really should be or used to be. This might be because Nike tried to make them more durable with reinforcements, but I don't buy Nike Free Running shoes for durability. I buy them for comfort. They're running shoes, they are supposed to be consumable after a season or so.Anyway, not recommended if you're after the kind of light, comfy running shoe that Nike Free used to be."

When I began my classes, I was wearing regular comfortable sneakers, and they didn't cut it. I was leaving class with knee pain and my hip joints were really struggling. These sneakers have completely turned my workout around! Highly recommend them, and will repurchase when needed.HOWEVER, I don't find them to be comfortable outside of fitness activities. I tend to take them off immediately before and after the gym because they are a very hard shoe and aren't the most comfortable for extended periods of walking.

Nice high arch support.  But the same model this year (2023) is built a little differently and my toe hits the end so I'm having to size up to 9.5 this time."

            "Combined_Review": "Be Careful about this shoe's upper material!! | Positive: This is a good looking shoe, and fits well.Negative: The VAMP (upper front of shoe) is made of a mesh-like fabric. It is so thin and transparent, that I could see my white sox right thru' this shoe!!! In the Pacific North-West where I live, where it rains a lot, I could only foresee that my sox and feet will be soaking wet within a minute when walking in the rain with this shoe. For that reason, I had to return it.If a future buyer wants to wear this shoe predominantly in-doors, e.g. inside a gym or your house, or your place of employment, then it may work for you; but positively NOT outdoors - should you live in a rainy climate (like I do)."

Die Verarbeitung ist so schlecht, dass ich bezweifle, dass die Schuhe den Sommer √ºberstehen. Gleich beim ersten Tragen sind innen die N√§hte gerissen, beim linken Schuh fast komplett bis zur Sohle, beim rechten Schuh nur die obersten N√§hte, aber ich trau mich nicht mal mehr, die Lasche anzufassen, weil es jedes Mal so aussieht, als ob die Naht weiter aufgeht. Auf dem linken Schuh sieht man dazu noch vorne an der Spitze einen wunderbaren Fleck, der so aussieht, als ob dort Kleber hingetropft w√§re. Von diesen Tropfern gab es noch ein paar mehr, die ich leider erst nach der ersten Proberunde gesehen habe. Einen konnte ich komplett abkratzen, was mir allerdings nicht bei allen gelang. Bei dem Preis darf so etwas einfach nicht sein."

So my advice, if you going to purchase these sneakers get them one size bigger. I ordered them in 8/12 and I‚Äôm a 8 in Men, and they were still extremely tight up front. I give this seller a 5 because I only had to answer one or two questions concerning why I was making this return, I got the return label in seconds after I answered those questions. Also I gave 5 because shipping and delivery was prompt as well. Overall I do recommend this seller and item."

They were more like walking on rocks.Too tight, too hard and no support.I have a narrow foot and theses were still to tight thought I ordered a 1/2 size up.Wore them for my first 3 patients then I took them off,  put them back in the box and later that day returned them to Amazon.Would not suggest or recommend if you are looking for comfort."

The shoes suffer from multiple defects and manufacturing or likely that they're counterfeit and not even authentic. I had a couple people look at them wondering the same thing. I own over 100 pairs that just Air Force ones all different sizes from mid- high and types. Even if they are legitimate. Nikes the manufacturing quality is very poor with all the loose stitching, bad stitching. The leather almost seems to be bubbling. If I would have known all of this I wouldn't have purchased them. Even the Air Force One logo on the shoelaces doesn't look like any of the ones from my other shoes, it's not metal or even a heavy plastic. I wouldn't even doubt it if these were actually used considering there was no inserts inside the shoes and how loose everything was."

The pair I received have material under the tongue that wasn‚Äôt cut with any kind of precision, it‚Äôs a hard plastic netting and cuts my feet without socks and is still annoying af with socks.  There‚Äôs also a raw edge near the ankle cuff that cuts into my ankle without socks.  Really rad looking shoes, but the labels on the tongue also fell off after 2nd wear.  Box was legit, they look legit, but the quality screams Chinese knockoff.  Have not contacted seller, beyond the 30 day period but can‚Äôt recommend buying shoes from this seller.  Could be just a bad PO from Nike, but very sus.  Never had, seen, or worn a Nike product that is this uncomfortable with multiple serious quality issues.  Buyer beware."

            "Combined_Review": "Not what I was expecting | First and foremost, this shoe is slightly smaller than you think. Not just in length, but in profile and width, as well. I recommend you go up a half size if possible. As a noonballer, I am not out here pounding court daily, 2-3 days a week for a an hour and a half or so at most. These shoes provide little to no cushion. The sole is super stiff to the point it makes my feet feel like the are slapping the court directly. The toe box is slim and the material over the toes is super low profile to the point you might not be able to change the insole. If you are into the zero drop idea and need a shoe that hugs your feet to the point of discomfort, or just want a flashy basketball shoe for the looks, this one might be for you."

            "Combined_Review": "Perfect Shoes for Colder Seasons | With the \"Militia Green\" colorway, Nike Air Max 97 Undeafeted is the perfect sneaker for the Fall. A once overhyped and overpriced sneaker turns into a forgotten gem. The pair of sneakers first caught my eye in 2021 and just a few days ago I finally got it. The Los Angeles retailer‚Äôs take on the shoes features olive green coloring throughout the leather upper, accented with a repeating string of Undefeated logos printed on the lowermost of the sneaker‚Äôs wavy overlays. Though the sneaker has full-length Max Air, the shoes don't feel as soft and bouncy as I thought they would. But I do like them a lot. The sneaker is warm and good-looking, matching the color of my backpack. I would like to recommend it to anyone who loves sneakers and would like to take the chance to try the air max 97."

There's black, red, blue specs covering the rubber bottom of the shoe.  \"Leather\" portion of the the shoe looks amazing, except for some stitching that is frayed (easily fixed with careful use of a bic lighter).  This leads me to believe the seller I chose is sending out rejected factory shoes they got their hands on that did not meet standards or perhaps shoes that were returned that had been previously worn by a pastel art painter (lol).  Not sure if I will return and repurchase do to time and hassle, going to try and figure out how to remove paint from rubber effectively (because other than that and the frayed stitching which can be easily fixed) these shoes are actually very hard to come by in specific sizings unless you want to buy from Ebay or small online retailers in Europe.Edit:  They were actually a different model of Nike that I received.  They were DH3160s and not CQ9246s.SELLER:  JMEGoods"

The Metcon is very sturdy at the expense of the flex and lightness of a typical minimalist shoe. Truly zero heel compared to the typical court shoe which is great for me. Had to go one full size up to get the room I get from the wide K Swiss shoe I've worn. Lets see how long this cross trainer will hold up."

They are always the most comfy for my foot and the sizes always ran true. Not so with this shoe. I don't know what changed but I definitely found them to be a little too short. No - my shoe size hasn't changed because I still buy the same size I have for years in other shoes. So I sent them back and rebought at half a size up. Voila! perfect fit and great comfort. Love them in the slightly larger size. I love that they are slightly lower cut which for me improves the comfort. My feet feel surrounded by softness."

I have other Nikes and the sizing is always fine. Think for the perfect fit i should've gone up a whole size. Ive never worn a 9. So i made the exchange work. Just had to loosen a lot. I like a snug fit around the center but these must run very snug, & small. Ultimately i kept the half size up pair. But careful even if you have a slightly wide foot. Even if you have a narrow foot. With a whole size up they must run small. But i love the design & color so i made them work. Lol"

The inside heel cushion on one shoe just collapsed. He has only worn them a month. I picked him up from school today to take him to dinner and he was walking on his tiptoe with one foot. I asked him why and he then showed me the collapsed heal. I couldn‚Äôt believe it!! These shoes are not cheap!!  Amazon said I‚Äôm a week past my 30 days. I would think that would be for changing mind or wrong fit. Surly there‚Äôs a different policy on defective items. He sent me photos hard to see, I circled the collapsed area. I don‚Äôt want money back just replaced."

            "Combined_Review": "Soft Flexible Heel | Purchased these shoes for walking on the treadmill.  What I like about the shoe is that the back heel is not made of a hard support, so it does not dig into the back of your foot.  They are very comfortable and not horribly heavy.  As the shoes are somewhat snug, I use a shoe horn to ease my foot into the shoe.  Unless you use a shoe horn or your finger back by your heel, the soft heel material will get scrunched down and you will not have proper fit.  It seems like Nike have traditionally fit on the narrow side, so beware if you have never purchased this brand before.  I usually take a medium width, and although these shoes fit, they are not as wide as other brand mediums."

            "Combined_Review": "Bad design - painful for high arch feet. Arrived dirty, no box or paper | The size actually fits correctly for me, from toe to heel. The issue is on the tongue, the stitching at the base of the tongue and stitching on the non-removable lock laces (the triangle bit closer to the toe) are painfully digging into the tops of my feet. The tongue is less flexible there as a result, coupled with the aggressive inner elastics pulling the tongue down on my feet. It is painful to walk in these shoes even with the laces removed. Really stupid design, considering the Nike price tag. See the photo of them on my feet (fitted without socks) and how much the tongue is stretching in that stitched area.It shipped with no box or paper stuffing whatsoever. It arrived with dirt on the soles and laces undone on one shoe.Size up if you must, as everyone else is recommending. I will be returning this and buying a different shoe. The design is really stupid - they could have avoided the unnecessary pain entirely if the inner elastics pulling the tongue down weren't aggressively tight and the stitching wasn't in that area."

I like thta these nike shoes are flat and provide a level surface to lift weights unlike regular running shoes. It does get some time getting used to as they are awkatd because they are completely flat and not cushioned. However, I am definitely buying when these take a hesvy beatting. I wish that for the next versions, there are more variety available for my size. 10.5. If you are into weight training, this is a mist have."

Meets its specification. after wearing these shoes they add to your style statement and really comfortable and fit very nicely.White is my favourite color. I ordered white color and the look is premium. Nike meets customer expectation. moreover for short sized foot also an extremely suitable size is available, that is amazing.I think if you are exploring shoe for gym daily wear or running activties, you should definetely go for it.

I ordered my usual size, but they turned out to be a full size too small. This was unexpected and frustrating, as I had high hopes for these shoes. The fit is snug and uncomfortable, making them less wearable than I had anticipated."

Imagine my surprise when I opened the box and found out it‚Äôs been worn. I dislike the fact that I paid for a new pair but got a used pair, it‚Äôs absolutely not okay. This is a rip off. The sneakers is okay, don‚Äôt even know if it‚Äôs the real thing but I like the way it fit. I just wish I got what I paid for. It‚Äôs very light weight and it‚Äôs definitely not true to size. I wear a size 7 but after reading the reviews I decided to get and 8 which is a perfect fit. Not sure about the comfort since I just got it."

I have trouble being on my feet for any length of time. I found these at a Nike outlet and tried them. They do not work well with the orthotics because they are low rise and my foot sits higher in the shoe. But they felt so comfortable I wanted to try them. I‚Äôve been wearing them w/o the orthotics for about 5 months and have purchased several more pairs before they are discontinued. My foot pain has subsided and I‚Äôm able to work most of the day with very minor discomfort unlike before. I love these shoes. I wear a size larger than my normal size 12 because Nikes have always fit small on me. 13‚Äôs fit perfect. I highly recommend."

I've spent months trying to recover from it. I don't expect to be fully healed for another 6 months since on average it can take a year to fully see the pain go away. There is too much heel sticking out of the back of the shoe. If you heel strike for any sustained amount of time it can lead to injury. The back of fabric of the shoe that caused my injury even has a tear/small hole. I intended to get some Nike frees, but those weren't available so I settled for these.

            "Combined_Review": "They are okay | I purchased these shows from Hibbetts but thought I'd leave a review.  These shoes run very very small. My normal size is 8.5, I ended up purchasing these in a size 10. Crazy right?? Nike shoes run very different from other styles. I am still in shock as to why I ended up with a size and a half bigger shoes. I had been wanting these shoes for months and finally caught them on sale and decided to grab them. As far as comfort, they're okay. I do not know why they are so expensive bc honestly my pumas fit more comfortable than these do. I feel it's just the aesthetic of the shoe that makes it so desirable. Would I purchase another pair... maybe in white but that's all. I'm not sure of the comfort levels are off bc they're so huge in size.or if the shoe was just hyped up so much.. either way I do like them, just for looks though. Do I recommend? Yes for looks only."

Shoe is very light and has just enough cushion.  Laces are thin and stay tied.Only issue is I suspect these won't be the most durable because the materials are lighter, but only time will tell."
